FASTX-Toolkit
* FASTQ/A Trimmer
    Shortening reads in a FASTQ or FASTQ files (removing barcodes or noise).
        $ fastx_trimmer -h
            usage: fastx_trimmer [-h] [-f N] [-l N] [-z] [-v] [-i INFILE] [-o OUTFILE]

            version 0.0.6
            [-h]         = This helpful help screen.
            [-f N]       = First base to keep. Default is 1 (=first base).
            [-l N]       = Last base to keep. Default is entire read.
            [-z]         = Compress output with GZIP.
            [-i INFILE]  = FASTA/Q input file. default is STDIN.
            [-o OUTFILE] = FASTA/Q output file. default is STDOUT.
* FASTQ Quality Filter
    Filters sequences based on quality
        $ fastq_quality_filter -h
            usage: fastq_quality_filter [-h] [-v] [-q N] [-p N] [-z] [-i INFILE] [-o OUTFILE]

            version 0.0.6
            [-h]         = This helpful help screen.
            [-q N]       = Minimum quality score to keep.
            [-p N]       = Minimum percent of bases that must have [-q] quality.
            [-z]         = Compress output with GZIP.
            [-i INFILE]  = FASTA/Q input file. default is STDIN.
            [-o OUTFILE] = FASTA/Q output file. default is STDOUT.
            [-v]         = Verbose - report number of sequences.
                            If [-o] is specified,  report will be printed to STDOUT.
                            If [-o] is not specified (and output goes to STDOUT),
                            report will be printed to STDERR.

# This will quality-trim to Q10 using the Phred algorithm, which is more accurate than naive trimming. 
# “qtrim=r” means it will trim the right side only; you can alternatively set “qtrim=l” for left or “qtrim=rl” for both. 
# If quality trimming is enabled, it happens after all kmer-based operations.

# Quality filtering:
# This will discard reads with average quality below 20. If quality-trimming is enabled, the average quality will be calculated on the trimmed read.
